This is the source code for the [Xpunge](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/xpunge/) add-on for Thunderbird.

This code is already publicly available in ATN, since it is contained in the xpi file. I have published it here to facilitate collaboration.

If you are looking for code with good coding conventions or code style, you are in the wrong place.
